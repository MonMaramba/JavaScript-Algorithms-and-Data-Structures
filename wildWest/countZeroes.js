// Divide and Conquer - countZeroes
// Given an array of 1s and 0s which has all 1s first followed by all 0s, write a function called countZeroes, which returns the number of zeroes in the array.
function countZeroes(array) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = array.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

    if (array[mid] === 1) left = mid + 1;
    else right = mid - 1;
  }

  return array.length - left;
